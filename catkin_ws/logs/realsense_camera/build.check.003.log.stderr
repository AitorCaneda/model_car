[33m[1mCMake Warning[0m at /home/mi/boroujeni/model_car/catkin_ws/src/camera/CMakeLists.txt:48 (add_library):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target
  realsense_camera_nodelet because files in some directories may conflict
  with libraries in implicit directories:

    runtime library [librealsense.so] in /usr/lib may be hidden by files in:
      /opt/odroid-x2/sdk/usr/lib

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
